To see the effect of sample size (from 1 to 30) on the sampling distribution, first, randomly construct the sampling distribution for each sample size. 
For this construction, matlab is used. 
For each sampling distribution, calculate the mean and variance in order to compare with the mean and variance of the population distribution. 
Also a report about the effect of sample size (from 1 to 30) on the sampling distribution by using figures is given.
